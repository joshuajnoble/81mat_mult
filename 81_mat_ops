One Hundred Matrix Multiplications:

This is the story of an operation. It could be a lot of different kinds of things, but the most important thing to say about it is that it's the story of a single operation told in a variety of forms. Some of these forms are only of interest historically, other pedagogically, others personally, others diagetically, others culturally. You may ask: what is the cultural relevance of an operation? That's an excellent question. It gets us to closer to an operation as well, unlike the other bifurcations of this operation we will have to leave for later in this story. One can imagine that there are the most basic of operations: add this to that. 1 + 2. Store the result somewhere else. As you may or may not know, this is, forgive my simplification, the essence of an operation on a computer. Multiply this, add that, subtract this, put the thing in one place together with the thing in another place, and then store them both in a third place. From humble beginnings, much like the acorn, or, more perhaps appropriately DNA. There is a bias in culture, in education, that we should proceed like an Aristotelean, first principles and such, until such point as we arrive at something deeply meaningful. But maybe we shouldn't proceed from such things, perhaps we should proceed from some whimsical operation. 

Before we begin we should should create a guidebook of sorts for our narrative. Let's do a thought experiment, when I say: "you", imagine that there is a formal structure that allows us to represent both "you-ness" and "me-ness" in a structured pattern, some elements of which are "you" and some elements of which are "me". Nothing will ever be entirely "you" nor will anything ever be entirely "me", we are instead speaking of a compound structure, a vector if you will, of intensities and relations. If they relate, let them relate. If they do not, don't worry, pretend we are in a boat floating in the Bodensee and that I am talking lazily, free associating, as we gaze up at the blue sky, enjoying a beer and the soft rocking of an inland sea.

The crux of the matrix is simple: N x M elements. We say it like this: "en by em". 3x1, for instance, a vector representing acceleration in three dimensional space.

Two matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable are always commutative.

Your favorite phrase, the one you return to again and again, a well-spring of kaleidoscopic fascination, revealing something new with each passing moment and turn of the wrist: "you don't know what you're doing". What could be more profound? You are doing something, in action, and yet you have no idea what it is [Feyerabend]. The body seems alive but the is divorced from it, zombies, demonic possession, witching, haunting, or worse yet, simple cognitive disfunction of the most profound sort: a divorce from the world. What is it that you're doing? Do you really have no conception?

In 2003 you are sitting in a small apartment in Brooklyn which belongs to a friend. yYou visiting from Boston where you live. You are in graduate school and you are you are living at the edge of your savings and you are frustrated with what you have chosen to do with your life which is to attend a graduate program in art. This was a horrible mistake. You are alternately depressed and torn with a fury of impotence at being unable to either make anything satisfying or feel satisfied about not making anything. You are looking at a page for the Whitney artport and you are staring at the code for a piece by Camille Utterbach. Then you click on the next link (it is two ">" symbols next to one another) and suddenly you see a word: processing. It is not spelled "processing" it is spelled "proce55ing". It strikes you as odd and endearing, quirkily affective. Later that evening you are going to attend an Animal Collective concert. You have asked a girl you know to meet you there. She won't show up but when you get back to Boston you tell her that you bought her a ticket and she will think that you are sweet and charming and spontaneous and some of these things are true.

To load a matrix in Processing, you call loadMatrix() and pass 16 floats. Of course, in 2003, this doesn't make much sense. You've never learned proper OpenGL and for a variety of reasons the interface to OpenGL in Processing is a bit obscured.

The origin of all great passions is typically obscure to all but those who experience them. There is a story that may or may not have been told you as you drank a beer about a young man in East Germany, the German Democratic Republic, the DDR, not simply "the East of Germany". This young man painstakingly typed instructions into an ancient and obscure machine which operated on memory stored on cassette tape to create simple ASCII art drawings and role playing games. He copied Assembly instructions from the pages of magazines which somehow found their way into his hands, hiding in his bedroom with a flashlight so as to escape the notice of his parents and which seemed to him an oracular revelation. Imagine the feeling when suddenly, in the early 1990's, he realized what his peers had been doing, just simple *handed* computers with discrete GPUs, with 16 bit graphics. The combination of both amazement and resentment, at once jealous and thrilled. But of course, to do a thing from scratch, to make do with scant resources blossoms a brilliant clarity of *what* an action consists of at its core. One thinks of the playing of trumpet scales or perhaps even The Karate Kid, waxing on and off, knowing not why he does what he does, but building slowly and painfully, an intuition. Not the Karate Kid here, that we are speaking of, rather the Assembly kid, soon to find his metier not through following the training but the course of it. A trumpet player does not play scales to be able to play scales, they play scales to discover jazz. Likewise, here, we see the fruits of another discovery:

The Matrix has that particular structure of java-ness to it: addSelf(), multiply(Matrix4x4 mat), none of the overloaded operators of other languages, a verbosity which may irritate but which should soothe: it says, speak to me and I will listen. None of these odd obscure hieroglyphics that create

It is not surprising that the beginnings of matrices and determinants should arise through the study of systems of linear equations. The Babylonians studied problems which lead to simultaneous linear equations and some of these are preserved in clay tablets which survive. For example a tablet dating from around 300 BC contains the following problem:-

There are two fields whose total area is 1800 square yards. One produces grain at the rate of 2/3 of a bushel per square yard while the other produces grain at the rate of 1/2 a bushel per square yard. If the total yield is 1100 bushels, what is the size of each field.

The Chinese, between 200 BC and 100 BC, came much closer to matrices than the Babylonians. Indeed it is fair to say that the text Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art written during the Han Dynasty gives the first known example of matrix methods. First a problem is set up which is similar to the Babylonian example given above:-

There are three types of corn, of which three bundles of the first, two of the second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second and one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second and three of the third make 26 measures. How many measures of corn are contained of one bundle of each type?

Now the author does something quite remarkable. He sets up the coefficients of the system of three linear equations in three unknowns as a table on a 'counting board'.


           1   2   3

           2   3   2

           3   1   1

          26  34  39


Our late 20th Century methods would have us write the linear equations as the rows of the matrix rather than the columns but of course the method is identical. Most remarkably the author, writing in 200 BC, instructs the reader to multiply the middle column by 3 and subtract the right column as many times as possible, the same is then done subtracting the right column as many times as possible from 3 times the first column. This gives


           0   0   3

           4   5   2

           8   1   1

          39  24  39


Next the left most column is multiplied by 5 and then the middle column is subtracted as many times as possible. This gives


           0   0   3

           0   5   2

          36   1   1

          99  24  39


from which the solution can be found for the third type of corn, then for the second, then the first by back substitution. This method, now known as Gaussian elimination, would not become well known until the early 19th Century.

A matrix in a texture. Of course. What is a pixel? It is a vector. What is a row of pixel? It is a vector. What is a vector of vectors? This is boring. Here is a challenge: I am sitting in a room where there are three lights. The first light is behind me, let's say that it's at my 5 o'clock. The second light is directly above me. The third light is on the desk next to my left hand, a desk lamp, tilted down to face the desk, illuminate the pen that my hand holds, the page that my hand rests upon. I am looking ahead at the wall in front of me where there is a poster of Copenhagen hung on the wall. My parents brought this poster back their trip overseas to Copenhagen, memorable because my Swedish grandmother watched my brother and I while my parents were gone and thus I was introduced to the evening serial drama and in particular to Dallas and the nefarious nature of JR Ewing. I digress: I am sitting in a room where there are three lights. Let us locate them relative to [0,0,0], that is, to me, camera, or rather, model-view-projection matrix that I am:

[0.2,1,-2], [0,-2,0], [-0.27,0.1,0.2]

Wonderful. Which lamp is the one behind me? I forget, the room is long time ago. And why am I there? I have insomnia, as I am prone to, an it comes in two varieties: quiet creeping dread stealing up on me, tickling me the way like the uncomfortable realization that someone is watching you; a manic drive that illuminates the evening and is, in this case, keeping me up writing the words to a musical short film that I will ultimately abandon. This is what happens to you when you watch too many Busby Berkeley movies, you are seized by strange dreams of musicals, of people bursting into song joyous and absurd. And so, here we are: I am staring into the poster, remembering JR Ewing and the soft edge of analog TV, the technicolor glow of the tanned faces and big blonde hair and the remarkable Cadillacs pulling past iron gates into never ending driveways that lead to mansions in the distance. The words I'm writing down, I remember, are:

Oh lie to me again,
I was so much happier then
There's nothing that I'd rather be
and though it cost me dignity

It had a januty rythmn to it. I was infatuated with the Magnetic Fields and held Stephen Merritts wry lyrics and exhausted baritone close to my heart through what seemed at the time, how quaint, endless early adult growing pains.

1. By Hand

Imagine that you are once again seated at a desk in a classroom beneath florescent lights which are now flicked off throwing the room into shadow and now again illuminated by an overhead projector. Onto the overhead projector is laid a sheet of transparency acrylic with the  bubbled but consistent handwriting of your teacher inscribing a single matrix.

[1,0,0,1]

Your teacher, she, shall we call her Mrs Sandberg, wets her lips loudly and looks down at the project, made Vincent Price by the light straying from the projector into the creases of her neck and the angular lines of her face.

"This", she says drily "is a matrix. It is a set of values that are grouped together to let you represent things like the speed of a car driving or the rotation of a satellite in space or a lot of other things. This matrix is a two by two matrix, it has two rows and two columns and" and then her voice falls away and you cannot recall what it is that she has said next. It doesn't matter. You are elsewhere then and so the memory of this dulls and frays. The sound of her voice? Its rasp and dry edge, preserved. The odd dactylic affectations as she explains linear algebra, always looking down and into the light of the projector and never up at her students? Preserved. Let us imagine a matrix then, of what is sensorily available, the qualia of your ninth grade classroom, and another matrix then of your dimming memory, looking back so many years:

NM = P

we can decompose M into several categories. For instance, distractions; you are obsessed with Gina S and the light bounce of the bob cut that she wears in stark contrast to the stiff teased hair favored by so many of the girls in your grade. You can remember staring into the broad margins of your textbook and trying to sketch the curve of her hairline, hence you cannot remember the beginnings of the explanation non-commutative nature of matrix multiplication. This will be brought to light with your poor performance on a quiz several days later. Also, you will have to erase that line later before returning the book at the end of the school year. These you remember because you can recall trying to mollify your mothers anger with your near zero score on that quiz by telling her about the bob cut. She is both puzzled and frustrated with your grades. Remains, by means of another event. What was the number of that room? It was etched into your mind then of course but now it has completely vanished, as has the route from that room to your locker and vice versa. You remembered it the next year, because you passed by it on the way to a different class (what, of course, has also vanished, perhaps a history class of some sort?). This is simply forgetfulness. There are other factors: the efficacy of senses. The smell? Indistinct. Industrial would be the best guess. The sound? Very much still breathing in the memory hall of recollection. Let us begin to express this, in a greatly reduced form:

[
Non-Commutative Nature of Matrix Multiplication, The Tone of the Whirr of the Projector Fan, The Clinking of the Flagpole Outside
Mrs. Sandbergs Gesticulations, The Inkdots at the Termination of Each Character On The Projector Films, How Much Money Do You Have In Your Pocket
The Nature of the Textbook, The Room Number of Your Classroom, What Are You Wearing
]

[
The Allure of the Bob Cut of Gina S, The Constant-ness of Its Use, How Difficult It Always Is To Pay Attention,
How Sad She Seems, How Much You Have Always Loved Handwriting, You Usually Got Free School Lunch,
How Dull They All Were, One Can Remember City Streets But Must Walk A Hall To Remember A Home, It Was Nearly Always Something Bland and Indistinguishable From Anyone Else
]

We can see how several of these remain, while others approach zero asymptotically: you are aware that you probably had some money in your pocket, the concept of money is still valid both then and now, the denominations, shape, weight, sheen, size, and iconography of it have not even changed. You never lose anything but you may well lose track of it.

[
Nearly Gone (That Explanation Of It Anyways), Perfectly Clear, Again Very Clear, Burned Into Memory
Their Existence But Not Their Nature, Very Clear, None,
None, They Were All Three Digit Numbers, None, None
]

Perhaps what we need then, Newtonian, is some manner of mapping one matrix into another over time. The day after the introduction of matrices we can assume the following:

[
Never Truly Present, Perfectly Clear, Perfectly Clear, Perfectly Clear
Perfectly Clear, Perfectly Clear, Perfectly Clear, Perhaps None You Were Always Horrible With Small Change,
Perfectly Clear, Perfectly Clear Though More By Instinct, Perhaps Clear Though Most of Your Wardrobe is Indistinguishable From Itself
]

What function maps one to the other? Or should we say, what matrix of functions map one to the other, as each qualia chosen here, from amongst the hundreds or even thousands available is made of many more, an infinity, or perhaps more analytically a set which is locally bounded. To the degree to which we choose to remember we can limit. To the degree to which we allow our neurosis free reign then the set becomes unbounded and quite quickly at that. But, no, calculus won't be for another two years.

Calculating this by hand, we can assume that we'll, like good students, leverage The Rule of Zaurus. This is not how you would do this today and parenthetically, would you do this today? You would not. You're required to do so long-hand though and in the neatest pencil that you can muster since this is, as much as correctness or intuition, of vital importance: neat lines, correctly formed numbers and letters. Let us begin, you lead the way:

[
L - NCNMM, 0, 0
0, L - TITECPF, 0
0, 0, L - WAYW
]

and then

[
L - NCNMM, -WPF, -CFO
-MSG, L - TITECPF, -HMMDYHIYP
-NoT, -RNoYC, L - WAYW
]

which leads us the rule of Zaurus:

[
L - NCNMM, -WPF, -CFO
-MSG, L - TITECPF, -HMMDYHIYP
-NoT, -RNoYC, L - WAYW
]
[
L - NCNMM, -WPF
-MSG, L - TITECPF
-NoT, -RNoYC
]

Odd blocks of apartment towers are visible in the distance, barnacled with cell towers and satellite dishes. The church school a girls school and so the shouts of children ring up the walls and into the heavy air.

1. Urban Matrix

What is Midtown Manhattan if not a Matrix and what is the routing from Midtwon to Washington Heights and back South again to the East Village and then over the Manhattan Bridget into Downtown Brooklyn turning north then into Williamsburg and finally ending up on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side if not a matrix multiplication of sort executed in heavy traffic at idiotic speeds by irresponsible young men and women racing one another for cheap backpacks and infamy? I'll let you rephrase that. What is a matrix if not a description of a territory and what is a transformation if not a route? One of the tricks of moving from place to place is understanding the transforms involved. Consider traffic, consider a man crossing the street, carrying a ppackagae and not looking up from his cellphone as you bear down on him at 25 miles an hour (40 kilometers) as you are going the wrong way. COnsider that calculus and consider making it again and again before you begin. This is called "routing". It is the skill of the messenger, a vital one at that, a lost art now made novel and romantic in its obscelescence. Consider again our route, lets map it.
